# Scriptreplay
Simple local/web viewer for console replays generated by `script` command.

Derived from https://github.com/ConradIrwin/showterm.io but

* with files select interface 
* without any server-side code

So you can easily use your replays with no worries about exposed secret passwords.

If you want to setup any intranet-sharing, feel free to implement any simple server side or just link some shared 
folder into `data` directory.

## Can do

* playback `script` -generated files (typescripts and timing files) with configurable terminal width
* generate json replay files from `script`-files in showterm.io-compatible format
* playback json replay files from local files or from data folder (example.json playback included)
* work from local folder without http server

## Can not do

* upload anything anywhere

## External libs

All libraries are embedded into repository.

* jquery
* jquery-ui
* term.js - (https://github.com/chjj/term.js) magical js terminal emulator
* showterm.js - (https://github.com/ConradIrwin/showterm.io) nice and simple replay player using term.js with speed control and progress slider.

## Usage

Write your replays and open them using web interface.

### just open index.html

Only limitation: "load packed json from server" is not working, cause it is using ajax requests, that are forbidden 
for `file://` protocol.

### publish using any http server

For example `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1234` and open http://127.0.0.1:1234/
